# Task 4 - Model Monitoring and Performance Tracking

In order to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the deployed model, a comprehensive monitoring strategy is essential. Here, I will outline the key performance metrics, alarm mechanisms, and the rationale behind their selection to support ongoing evaluation and maintenance of the model in a batch deployment environment.

## Performance Metrics:

To track the accuracy and consistency of the model, the following metrics will be monitored regularly, along with them, to detect potential issues such as data drift, performance degradation, or anomalies, automated alarms will be set up with defined thresholds:

### Prediction Accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score

Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances. Essential for evaluating overall model performance over time. Triggered if accuracy, precision, or recall drops below a predefined threshold (ex; 5-10% deviation). Ensures timely intervention to retrain or recalibrate the model and ensure that the model continues to deliver reliable predictions that align with business objectives.

### Data Drift Metrics (ex: Population Stability Index - PSI, Kullback-Leibler Divergence - KLD)

Compares incoming data distributions to the training data to identify shifts over time. Crucial for understanding if the underlying data patterns are evolving. Activated when statistical drift metrics (ex: PSI > 0.2) indicate significant shifts in input data distribution. It prevents the model from making inaccurate predictions due to changing data patterns, also, monitoring shifts in data distribution helps to proactively address changes in customer behavior, market trends, or operational factors.

### Feature Importance Drift

Monitors changes in the relative importance of input features. Ensures that key predictors remain consistent and relevant. Early detection of performance degradation prevents prolonged exposure to faulty predictions, reducing potential business risks. It insures that the most influential variables remain stable over time, preserving model interpretability and trustworthiness.

### Processing Time Monitoring

Alerts if batch processing time exceeds acceptable limits, indicating potential scalability or infrastructure issues.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring Plan:

The following steps can be implemented to ensure model monitoring and performance tracking:

Automated Batch Evaluations: Scheduled evaluations of key metrics after each batch processing cycle.

Regular Reporting: Weekly or monthly performance reports for stakeholders to assess the modelâ€™s performance.

Retraining Strategy: A predefined schedule for model retraining if degradation exceeds acceptable thresholds.

Logging and Auditing: Comprehensive logging of model inputs, predictions, and outcomes to facilitate root cause analysis in case of issues.

By implementing this monitoring strategy, we can ensure the model remains reliable to evolving data patterns over time.
